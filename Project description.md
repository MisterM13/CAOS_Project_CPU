# CAOS project: making a CPU
## Project description

### Oversight:
We are planning to make an 8-bit CPU. For that we use different gates and a breadboard (for more see material requirements). Our Group is composed of  Barththan Sivanantham, Kian Hugenschmidt and Matthias MÃ¼ller.

### Supportet Operations by the CPU:
* the three load instructions (ldi, ldr, ld)
* an instruction to load data from the registry on the memory
* Basic calculation options (multiplication, addition, subraction, division)
* command operations: branch, jump and nop

### Input/Output
The input and output is handled with integrated LEDs and Buttons.

### Material requirements:* 100 Logic Gate Chips each ( AND, OR, NAND, XOR, NOR, NOT, Buffer)											-> ca 60 Fr.
* 20 Breadboards/5 big breadboards 	-> ca 80 Fr.
* a Power Supply Unit							-> ca 50 Fr.
* two ammeters										-> (ca 40 Fr.)[^1]
* 200 cables with different length		-> ca 50 Fr.
* 2 clock chips										-> ca 2 Fr.
* 64 d-flipflops 										-> ca 16 Fr.
* 4 Ram memory chips							-> ca 20 Fr.
* 4 eeprom chips									-> ca 2 Fr.
* 20 LED 												-> ca 5 Fr.
* 20 Buttons											-> ca 5 Fr.
* 200 resistors										-> ca 20 Fr.
* 20 condensators									-> ca 10 Fr.
* eventually a Solding station with equipment ->(ca 50 Fr.)[^1]

Total Costs estimation:  ca 340 Fr. (+ 90 Fr. )[^1]
