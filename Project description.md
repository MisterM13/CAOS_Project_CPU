# CAOS project: making a CPU
## Project description

### Oversight:
We are planning to make an 8-bit CPU. For that we use different gates and a brackedboard (for more see material requirements). Our Group is composed of  Barththan Sivanantham, Kian Hugenschmidt and Matthias MÃ¼ller.

### Supportet Operations by the CPU:
* the three load instructions (ldi, ldr, ld)
* an instruction to load data from the registry on the memory
* Basic calculation options (multiplication, addition, subraction, division)
* command operations: branch, jump and nop

### Material requirements:
* 100 Logic Gates each ( AND, OR, NAND, XOR, NOR, NOT, Buffer)											-> ca 60 Fr.
* 20 Breadboards/5 big breadboards 	-> ca 80 Fr.
* a Power Supply Unit							-> ca 50 Fr.
* two ammeters										-> (ca 200Fr.)
* 200 cables with different length
* a clock chip
* 4 memory chips
* 20 LED 
* 20 Buttons
* eventually a Solding station with equipment
